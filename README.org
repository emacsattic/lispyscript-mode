* LispyScript Mode

A major mode for [[http://lispyscript.com/][LispyScript]].

** Installation

LispyScript mode is available as a package on Marmalade. If you
haven't already, you can hook up to Marmalade with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
    '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

Then call: =M-x package-install lispyscript-mode=

/Alternatively/, just grab the single =lispyscript-mode.el= and install that in your preferred way.

** Status

Ready to use, but fairly basic. Feedback welcomed.
